# =============================================================================
# BACKEND FEATURES DISABLED FOR STATIC DEPLOYMENT
# =============================================================================
# This file contains backend utilities that have been disabled to convert the
# website to a static frontend-only site for deployment to Netlify/Vercel.
#
# REASON FOR DISABLING:
# - Analytics tracking requires server-side processing
# - Form processing requires backend database integration
# - Content management requires server-side logic
# - Airtable integration requires server-side API calls
#
# TO RE-ENABLE BACKEND FEATURES:
# 1. Uncomment all code below this section
# 2. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
# 3. Set up Airtable API keys in environment variables
# 4. Run the Flask application: python app.py
#
# BACKEND FEATURES THAT WERE DISABLED:
# - GCNAnalytics: Page view tracking, resource click tracking, form submission tracking
# - GCNFormProcessor: Form validation, Airtable integration, data processing
# - GCNContentManager: Dynamic content management, event management
# - GCNUtilities: Helper functions for data processing
# =============================================================================

# COMMENTED OUT - All backend features disabled for static deployment
# The entire enhanced_features.py file has been commented out because it contains
# server-side functionality that is not needed for static website deployment.
#
# Original file contained:
# - Analytics tracking classes and methods
# - Form processing with Airtable integration
# - Content management utilities
# - Data validation and processing functions
#
# For static deployment, these features are replaced with:
# - Client-side analytics (Google Analytics, etc.)
# - Static form handling (Netlify Forms, Formspree)
# - Static content (no dynamic content management needed)
# - Client-side form validation

# =============================================================================
# END OF COMMENTED BACKEND FEATURES
# =============================================================================
# All backend functionality has been disabled for static deployment.
# The website now operates as a pure frontend application with no server-side
# processing requirements.
