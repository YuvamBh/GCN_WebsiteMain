# These Python dependencies are no longer needed since the website has been
# converted to a static frontend-only site for deployment to Netlify/Vercel.
#
# REASON FOR DISABLING:
# - No Python backend is required for static hosting
# - All server-side functionality has been removed
# - Form handling is now done via static form providers
# - No server-side processing is needed
#
# TO RE-ENABLE BACKEND:
# 1. Uncomment the dependencies below
# 2. Install with: pip install -r requirements.txt
# 3. Run the Flask application: python app.py
